# CrashBerryRacer
A simple race game for a Raspberry Pi 2 and Sense HAT

This drop-down race game on the 8x8 LED display of the SensorHAT was created as a demo project during a 3 hour coding challenge at work. 

Simply build, deploy to the Pi and use the built-in gyroscope to move the race car left or right.
